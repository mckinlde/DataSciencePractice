I'm going to use this repo to brush up on data science stuff for interviews.

Expect files to be named by the chart they make, algorithm they implement, etc.

Because I don't want to pay for storage, data will be missing.  If it's publicly sourced data I'll link the source, 
if it's data I scraped I'll show the format in comments.
